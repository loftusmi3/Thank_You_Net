Welcome to Thank You Net!

I want to build a social media platform for sending thank you notes.  There’s so much division, anxiety, and loneliness in the world, and I believe that it’s one way that I could help bring people together.<br/>

The premise of the platform is that when someone sends a thank you note, it serves as a prompt for the receiver to send another thank you note to someone they’re grateful for as a random act of kindness.  This would form a chain of thank you notes among users, and since the platform tracks everything digitally, users can see how their chain of thank you notes propagates throughout the globe and visualize the impact it had on bringing the world together.<br/>

Earlier this August, I began learning web development so that I can build a prototype of the platform for the Future of Data Hackathon.  This is what I came up with for my submission!  There's plenty more left to do but it gets the idea across.

Many thanks to Dave Gray's coding tutorials and PrepBytes for extensive starter code and guidance :)


Set up:
The backend directory is the server, and the frontend directory is the client-side frontend.
Run npm i in the backend and the frontend to install packages, and then start both the server and the frontend with npm start.
